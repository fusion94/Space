Space.app: virtual workspaces for Mac OS X
==========================================

_version 0.8 (fifth release) 4 June, 2002_

![Shot 1](https://raw.github.com/fusion94/Space/master/SpaceShot-new.jpeg)

### Description
Space provides "virtual workspaces" to help you to organize your use of the
desktop. Space.app is provided free of charge for individual and commercial use 
under the QPL (version 1.0) and may be redistributed according to the terms of
that license.

### Call to Arms
I have many more feature requests for Space.app than I have time to work on. If you are interested in helping this application to mature, please consider contributing your code to this project.

### Known Issues
Switching between workspaces while applications are still in the process of hiding or unhiding may cause those applications to appear in different workspaces than you intended.
